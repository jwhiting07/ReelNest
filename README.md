GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE reelnestdb TO reelnest;
```

3. Run Flyway migrations:
```bash
cd backend

```

4. Update AWS credentials (for development, store locally in ~/.aws/credentials):
```bash
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
region = us-east-1
```

5. Run the backend:
